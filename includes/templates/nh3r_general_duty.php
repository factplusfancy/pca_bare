// General duty for anhydrous-ammonia mechanical refrigeration (ammonia refrigeration).
// This division method matches the Cheesehead division method, except the following.
// (1) A five-year "hazard review" division replaces the PHA division, but includes compliance practices from the "PSM audit" division
// because a semi-quantitative PHA is not required, instead the PSM audit sample-observation methods, 
// intended to cover IIAR 9 and much more, provide a checklist for a general-duty hazard review.
// (2) It doesn't include the following Cheesehead divisions: 
// (2.1) PSM audit (required every 3-years by the PSM rules) and 
// (2.2) offsite hazard assessment and reporting. 
// Offsite hazard assessment, in other words "identify hazards which may result from [accidental] releases 
// using appropriate hazard assessment techniques" (Clean Air Act 112(r)(1)),
// is covered by checking, and attempting to ensure, that the emergency plan of the community
// where the facility is located has an adequate offsite hazard assessment.
// For example, see includes/templates/nh3r_hspswp_ep_usa.php > Emergency Action Plan > item 9.1.
//
// This file inserts a division method (into t0rule), divisions, rule fragments, and needed additional practices,
// maps divisions to fragments and practices, and
// maps fragments to practices.
//
// This file must be run AFTER running includes/templates/nh3r_hspswp_ep_usa.php and nh3r_itm.php for their
// compliance practices to be selected and mapped to the general duty for ammonia refrigeration divisions.
// See setup_nh3r_practices.php
