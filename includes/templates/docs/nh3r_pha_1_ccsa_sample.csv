At the facility, these controls and safety shutoffs include the following.
* Redundant safeguards, via local controls in the compressor packages, in addition to the central ammonia-refrigeration controls.
* On the vessel [VESSELS] that feeds the all facility ammonia-refrigerant compressors, [__LIST VESSEL(S)__], these include:
- a level probe, which outputs to controls that [OFTEN OPTIONAL]
> signal alarms at an alarm level and then, [OFTEN OPTIONAL]
> on high-level, send shutoff signals to compressor local controls, [OFTEN OPTIONAL]
- a high-high-level float switch for compressor-safety shutoff, wired fail safe (no signal or open circuit causes shut off) and independently from the central ammonia-refrigeration controls.
* In all the ammonia-refrigerant compressor packages, these compressor-safety shutoffs include, at least:
- compressor motor high current (amps) -- also called overload or overcurrent protection,
- compressor motor high temperature (thermal protection),
- high discharge pressure,
- low suction pressure, and
- low oil pressure (the differential pressure that drives lubricating-oil flow, such as shaft-seal-chamber pressure minus suction pressure in Vilter reciprocating compressors).
* In the ammonia-refrigerant screw-compressor packages, these compressor-safety shutoffs also include, at least:
- high discharge temperature, of the ammonia-refrigerant gas,
- high oil-filter differential pressure, 
- high oil temperature (after cooling and typically before injection into the screw lubrication system), 
- low oil temperature (also prevents the screw compressor from starting until the oil heater has adequately warmed the oil), 
- oil-pump motor high current (amps), and
- oil-pump motor high temperature (thermal protection).
* All of the above compressor-safety shutoffs: 
- fail safe (no signal or open circuit causes shut off) and
- cause local compressor controls to de-energize compressor-package components as needed for safe shut off, including
> the compressor motor,
> the oil heater (except in special cases when an automatic restart may be allowed),
> any oil-pump motor,
> any liquid-injection cooling pump motors and/or solenoid valves.
* Local screw-compressor controls:
- prevent all motors in the compressor package from starting too often,
- automatically unload screw-compressor slide valves (capacity control and volume ratio) when the compressor shuts off or when power is restored after a power outage,
- prevent restart until slide valves are unloaded to below 10% of their limits, and
- correct most slide-valve drift via anti-drift functions.
[OR SLIDE-VALVE DRIFT MAY BE ADDRESSED VIA ITM]
* The central ammonia-refrigeration controls:
- prevent the compressors from starting too often and
- automate their starting, loading, unloading, and shutoff.
* Inspection, testing, and maintenance (ITM) of the above controls and safeguards are scheduled, described, and documented in
- the facility's maintenance-management system.
*** The following apply to the ammonia-refrigeration system at the facility. ***
* Overheating lowers the viscosity of lubricating oil, which at high enough temperatures causes 
- inadequate lubrication. This leads to 
- increased wear-and-tear on internal parts, 
- often, increased oil leakage from the shaft seal, and
- possibly, ammonia leakage from the shaft seal.
* Additional overheating causes friction that makes the drive shaft harder to turn, increasing the load on the compressor motor, and eventually causing the compressor to seize up (the electric motor cannot turn the shaft).
* In the reciprocating compressors, the crank shaft drives the oil pump, so the low-oil pressure switch should shutoff the compressor motor. If not, high current (amps) protection should shut off the compressor motor,
- except with a belt drive, if a problem (belt breaks, slipping , etc.) causes the motor to run faster than the compressor, the low-oil pressure switch should shutoff the compressor motor. If not, the motor many overheat and, if also not thermally protected, damage insulation, rarely but possibly leading to a small fire that might be the source of a larger fire.
* Overheating, described above, and possibly small ammonia leaks, would be the typical result of gas recirculating from the discharge to suction sides of a reciprocating-compressor crank case because:
- it is running with the discharge valve shut between the compressor and the oil separator (deadheading) and its high discharge-pressure shutoff fails when needed
> causing its internal pressure-relief valve to open, or
- rapid leak by this internal pressure-relief valve.
* The screw compressors are protected from high-oil temperatures by
- high oil temperature shutoffs,
- high discharge temperature shutoffs, 
- compressor motor high current (amps) shutoffs (if friction increases due to inadequate lubrication), and 
- low oil pressure shutoffs, triggered by the low-oil pressure if the screws seize up because the above shutoffs failed.
* If the following shutoffs are not installed or fail when needed, overheating, described above, and possibly small ammonia leaks, would be the typical result:
- low suction pressure (compressor starved),
- low oil pressure (inadequate oil flow for cooling, lubricating, and seals),
- high oil-filter differential pressure (inadequate oil flow for cooling, lubricating, and seals),
- high oil temperature (or cooling-water low-flow switch, if applicable),
- high discharge temperature,
- compressor motor high current (amps) -- as backup to the above.
*  If the following shutoff is not installed or fails when needed, increased wear and tear would result, if not shut off on low oil pressure,
- low oil temperature.
* Compressor equalizing to suction too quickly, due to 
- leak by screw-compressor suction check valve or
- reciprocating-compressor suction stop valve opened too quickly, may
- suck some oil out of the compressor or
- cause pressure in the shaft-seal chamber to be different than in the suction side of the compressor, particularly for reciprocating compressors. This may move the inner shaft seal, causing oil to spray from the shaft-seal chamber onto the compressor internal components, leading to increased wear.
* Compressor loading up too quickly:
- has little effect on reciprocating compressors,
- may lead to wear or internal damage to screw-compressor packages, including their motors,
- if this results in a rapid suction pressure drop, excessive refrigerant boiling in vessels that feed compressors may cause liquid droplets to reach compressors, see the scenario on liquid ammonia sucked into compressors, lots of large droplets or more (slugging).
* If a screw-compressor oil-pump inlet or outlet valve is closed when the oil pump starts or is running:
- the compressor local controls would not start the compressor motor, or would shut it off (for low-stage/booster compressors that run the oil pump during normal operation), due to low oil pressure,
> which, possibly after a time delay, would cause the compressor local controls to shut off the oil-pump motor, or otherwise
- the oil-pump motor may be shut off by its high current (amps) or thermal protection.
- If the oil-pump outlet valve is closed (or both the inlet and outlet valves are closed) and the oil pump motor isn't shutoff by the above safeties, this may cause:
> a leak, mostly oil, at the motor-shaft seal, a valve-stem seal, or some piping joints,
> any pump internal pressure-relief device, from outlet to inlet, to open [CHECK IF THE PUMP HAS INTERNAL PRESSURE RELIEF],
> [IF NOT LIQUID INJECTION COOLED] the oil-cooler, oil-side, pressure-relief valve to open and relieve the pressure by allowing oil flow back to the compressor oil separator that feeds the oil pump."

The facility's ammonia-refrigeration system has the following in place.
* Hot-gas defrost (HGD) piping pitches to
- a liquid drainer,
- high-stage discharge (HSD) piping that evaporates any condensed liquid or carries it to condensers without causing vapor propelled liquid slugs, such as because the continuous gas flow in the HSD piping is much greater than any condensed-liquid flow entering from HGD piping,
- or another safe location.
* Rules of thumb that are followed:
- soft start of hot-gas defrost (soft gas) is needed if the hot-gas solenoid valve is 1.5-inch (nominal size) or larger or if the evaporating temperature is below zero Fahrenheit (0 F),
- suction control valve slow-opening or bleed-by is needed if suction control valves are 2.5-inch (nominal size) or larger or if the evaporator coil is 15 tons refrigeration (TR) or larger, and
- each forced-air evaporator above 1 TR is served by a separate valve group, which includes the liquid, suction, and hot-gas control valves.
* Defrost, hot gas, includes adequately gradual and long delay and/or pump-down times (optionally lengthened by interlocked pressure transducers), both before and after defrost:
- the before-defrost pump-down time is adequate to remove liquid ammonia from the evaporator coil and piping that hot gas will enter, avoiding shocks, such as from:
> vapor-propelled liquid slugs and condensation-induced shock,
- the after-defrost delay and/or pump-down time (also called equalize or bleed time) is adequately gradual and long to avoid excessive shocks in both:
> the suction piping downstream of the suction control valve, when it opens or regulates at a lower pressure, and
> the evaporator coil and piping, when liquid ammonia-refrigerant enters them to restart cooling.
* Metal fatigue due to rapid temperature changes is also reduced by both of the above pump-down times.
* The before-defrost pump-down time is also long enough to remove all liquid ammonia under reasonable worst-case scenarios, based on operating experience or by assuming the evaporator coil may be mostly full of liquid due to a low load, maybe because the coil was heavily frosted up before defrost due to higher than usual humidity in the cooled air.
* There is no incentive to unsafely reduce pump-down times because doing so would not increase production [OR DESCRIBE PASSWORDS OR OTHER CONTROLS THAT PREVENT REDUCING PUMP-DOWN TIMES] and the current timing has worked well since at least [__YEAR__] [OR DESCRIBE TESTING THAT WAS DONE TO VERIFY THE PUMP-DOWN TIMES].
* At the start and end of a power outage or blip, shutoff and restart occur safely regardless of the state an evaporator was in when the power failed, for example:
- if a suction control valve automatically opens (or regulates at a lower pressure) when power fails during defrost,
> excessive shocks won't occur,
> any needed slow-opening or bleed-by function adequately when the power fails,
- for all types of suction control valves, there is adequate
> pump-down to suction pressure after power is restored, before control valves allow either liquid or hot gas into evaporators [NEEDS DEPEND ON IF CONTROLS RETAIN MEMORY OF EVAPORATOR STATE BEFORE POWER OUTAGE],
> freeze on (also called rechill) before fans start, as needed to prevent water droplets from blowing onto people, product, etc.,
> staggering of valve openings, to avoid excessive flows in piping headers or to vessels,
* If run-time clocks are reset by a power outage or blip, controls stagger them on restart so that needed defrosting happens soon but all evaporators do not defrost at once."

* has temperature control via thermostat [OR DESCRIBE OTHER ADEQUATE CONTROL],
* has emergency-ventilation control via manual on/auto switch and ammonia sensors,

> valves, or
> work of any kind.
- If opening the ammonia-refrigeration system to the atmosphere, these authorized personnel get and follow:

> a system-opening permit (also called line-breaking permit) and/or
> a procedure for the activity that is described in writing and approved by the facility's qualified ammonia-refrigeration system contractor or the responsible individual(s), per the Owner/Operator management system, such as for routine oil draining or for tie-in of new equipment;
- the above address and, as needed, have warnings about:
> verifying no leak-by (backflow across) check valves when compressors or pumps are shutoff,
> ammonia buildup under rarely opened seal caps, covering valve stems without hand wheels,
> packing leaks, especially when valves are moved off their fully back-seated position,
> loosening threaded bonnets when turning the stems of control or stop valves, if applicable,
> properly lubricating valve stems (but not with copper-containing anti-seize),
> not using too much force when turning valve stems or seal caps,
> trapping liquid ammonia when shutting valves,
> leaks when equipment or piping is opened to the atmosphere, such as from leak by the seat of an isolating valve, which may be addressed by monitoring pressure after isolating but before opening part of the ammonia-refrigeration system,
> shock cooling, including by venting equipment or piping that still contains liquid ammonia to the atmosphere,
> draining oil from a compressor without shutting off and locking out its oil heater,
> accidental return of hazardous energy to opened equipment or piping,
> leaks or shocks when valves are opened to put equipment back in service.
- If connecting joints (bolted, threaded, welded...) or support fasteners, these authorized personnel:
> follow applicable good practices, procedures, and manufacturer instructions, such as
> for threaded joints, clean threads and apply pipe-thread compound or equivalent, compatible with the ammonia-refrigeration system, before properly tightening.
- If disabling safety systems for maintenance, such as emergency ventilation, these authorized personnel:
> follow a procedure for the activity that is described in writing and approved by the facility's qualified ammonia-refrigeration system contractor or the responsible individual(s), per the Owner/Operator management system,
- If replacing pressure-relief valves, these authorized personnel:
> get and follow a system-opening permit (also called line-breaking permit),
> when practical, pump down to suction pressure and safely isolate equipment and piping before replacing the pressure-relief valve(s) serving that equipment and piping (except for large vessels, like the receiver and recirculator vessels, this is often practical and safe), and 
> otherwise (if not practical to isolate before replacement) they (A) check that the ammonia-refrigeration system is operating properly before starting pressure-relief valve replacement, (B) have a watcher who can initiate emergency plans, including any needed and safe leak mitigation, and (C) wear appropriate personal protective equipment, considering the possibility that another pressure-relief valve opens on a shared inlet valve or shared outlet relief-vent piping or that they accidentally remove an in-service pressure-relief valve,
- After a  power failure, leak, or emergency shutdown, these authorized personnel follow (or develop for Owner/Operator approval prior to restart) procedures for these that cover:
> how the ammonia-refrigeration system, including its controls, responds to power blips, outages, and power restoration (including interrupted defrosting, if applicable),
> any needed human actions during outages or upon power restoration,
> restart after shutdowns due to a high level in a vessel that feeds compressors, and
> restart after ammonia leaks or emergency shutdowns.
