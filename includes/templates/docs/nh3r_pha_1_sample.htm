        <h2>
        Background on the process, applicable PHA rules, and past PHA or revisions history</h2>
        <p>[VERIFY EVERYTHING IN THIS SAMPLE INTRODUCTION.] <br>
<br>
The [OWNER/OPERATOR NAME], [FACILITY NAME], located at [FACILITY STREET ADDRESS OR LOCATION] (the facility) had records indicating that its:<br>
* closed-loop mechanical ammonia-refrigeration system (the ammonia-refrigeration system) <br>
* contained approximately [_________] pounds of anhydrous ammonia, as of [DATE].<br>
<br>
As a result, the following require a process-hazard analysis (PHA) update and revalidation every five years: <br>
* Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations at Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1910.119 (29 CFR 1910.119), implemented by U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and<br>
* Program 3 Prevention Program regulations at 40 CFR 68, Subpart D, implemented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).<br>
The PSM rules are designed to protect employees by safely managing processes that use highly hazardous chemicals, such as anhydrous ammonia. The EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP, also called Risk Management Plan, RMP) rules (40 CFR 68), are designed to protect the surrounding community from similar hazards.<br>
<br>
This report includes recommended actions developed by the PHA team. Many of these are not specifically required by codes or regulations. They may be optional, depending on judgment about whether the current situation is reasonably safe, and so meets the general duty and PSM good-practice rules. The PHA team did not evaluate health, safety, environmental, engineering, construction, financial, security or other considerations required for implementing recommended actions, resolution options, or other suggestions made in this report. Safe and effective resolution of recommended actions -- including careful evaluation of resolution options or other suggestions made in this report and also including means, methods, and sequences -- remains the responsibility of the Owner/Operator of the facility or contractors that may take on specific projects.<br>
<br>
<b>Resolution of PHA Recommended Actions</b><br><br>
Any imminently dangerous situations should be immediately controlled. The risk ranking, based on likelihood and severity, helps assess this. Otherwise, the PSM final rule preamble indicates, "It is OSHA's intention that the actions to be taken as a result of the process hazard analysis recommendations be completed as soon as possible. In most cases, OSHA believes that employers will be able to complete these actions within a one to two year time frame, but notes that in unusual circumstances longer completion periods may be necessary." (57 Federal Register 6379, February 24, 1991) <br>

Facility PHA History<br>
[IF APPLICABLE, PUT HISTORY HERE, INCLUDE TEAM LEADERS, TEAM MEMBERS, AND COMPLETION DATES.]</p>
        <a id="c6team_qualifications"></a>
        <h2>
        Team qualifications and information reviewed</h2>
        <p>[PSM CONTRACTOR-ORGANIZATION OR EMPLOYEE NAME] assisted [OWNER/OPERATOR NAME] with completing this [YEAR] PHA update and revalidation [OR INITIAL PHA], with additional assistance from [REFRIGERATION CONTRACTOR-ORGANIZATION NAME].<br>
<br>
The PHA update and revalidation team included:<br>
[NAMES, TITLES, AND COMPANIES OF TEAM MEMBERS]<br>
[ENSURE THESE MEET APPLICABLE COMPETENCY REQUIREMENTS OR EMPLOYEE-PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS<br>
* 29 CFR 1910.119(e)(4)) The process hazard analysis shall be performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, and the team shall include at least <br>
- one employee [OR CONTRACTOR INDIVIDUAL] who has experience and knowledge specific to the process being evaluated. Also, <br>
- one member of the team must be knowledgeable in the specific process hazard analysis methodology being used.<br>
* 29 CFR 1910.119(c)(2) Employers shall consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of process hazards analyses...]<br>
<br>
[DESCRIBE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PHA TEAM LEADER IN DETAIL AND ALSO OF THE OTHER PHA TEAM MEMBERS, AS NEEDED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT COMPETENCY AND EMPLOYEE-PARTICIPATION ARE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED.]<br>
<br>
The PHA team members gained experience and knowledge specific to the facility's ammonia-refrigeration system as follows.<br>
<br>
[DESCRIBE:<br>
* DOCUMENTS REVIEWED,<br>
* PEOPLE COMMUNICATED WITH, SUCH AS BY PHONE CALLS OR EMAILS, AND<br>
* THINGS OBSERVED.]</p>
        <a id="c6method"></a>
        <h2>
        Method</h2>
        <p>The [YEAR] PHA update and revalidation team (the team) used the [LIST METHOD, WHICH SHOULD MEET APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS AT 29 CFR 1910.119(e)(2), FOR EXAMPLE] what-if/checklist method, similar to the methods used for the initial PHA and previous PHA updates and revalidations at the facility. This is a hazard identification and risk analysis (HIRA) method intended to: <br>
* identify and evaluate hazards and existing safeguards, including those revealed by, related to, or amplified by<br>
- prior incidents, facility siting, and human factors and also including <br>
- engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards, their interrelationships, and consequences of their failure,<br>
* provide a semi-quantitative risk assessment for each hazard (including the failure of controls), which moderately exceeds the required "qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls", <br>
* make recommendations (called recommended actions in this report), and so <br>
* satisfy the PHA requirements of the PSM and CAP rules cited above.<br>
<br>
The team communicated synchronously from [DATE] to [DATE] and asynchronously, via email, from [DATE] to [DATE].<br>
<br>
Synchronous communications.  All times in [TIME ZONE].<br>
[LIST IN-PERSON MEETINGS, VIDEO CONFERENCES WITH SCREEN SHARES, PHONE CALLS, AND OTHER SYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATIONS.]<br>
<br>
Asynchronous communications. <br>
See emails records, from [DATE] to [DATE], which [PSM CONTRACTOR-ORGANIZATION NAME (OR, IF THE PHA-TEAM LEADER WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE OWNER/OPERATOR) OWNER/OPERATOR NAME] intends to keep on file for at least ten years.<br>
<br>
Before and during the above communication period, the team leader verified that the process-safety information, augmented by the PHA team's ability to observe the as-built ammonia-refrigeration system, was adequate to complete the PHA.<br>
<br>
[DESCRIBE ANYTHING COVERED IN THE PHA MEETINGS THAT IS NOT ADEQUATELY DESCRIBED IN THE PHA REPORT'S SCENARIOS.]<br>
<br>
As part of completing the PHA update and revalidation, the following were assessed and developed for common as well as site-specific scenarios (what-if questions):<br>
* previous incidents at the facility or elsewhere, <br>
* other possible failures or applicable scenarios, including<br>
- engineering-controls or administrative-controls failures, <br>
- hazards created or amplified by human factors or facility siting, and<br>
- any significant interrelationships among all of the above,<br>
* possible causes,<br>
* possible consequences, <br>
* existing safeguards, at/for/in the facility and its ammonia-refrigeration system, <br>
* severity with existing safeguards in place, and <br>
* likelihood of the above severity with existing safeguards in place,<br>
* recommended actions, if needed.<br>
<br>
Aerial images, local maps, floodplain maps, seismic-hazard maps, site and floor plans, the ammonia-refrigeration system flow diagram, piping &amp; instrumentation diagram (P&amp;ID), component-manufacturer documentation, and other process-safety information were reviewed as needed to evaluate scenarios.<br>
<br>
Risk rankings were assigned to each scenario, based on their severity and likelihood, using the risk-ranking matrix below.<br>
<br>
A risk ranking was also assigned to each recommended action based on the highest risk ranking of a scenario with which the recommended action was associated.</p>
        <a id="c6prior_incident_id"></a>
        <h2>
        Identification of applicable previous incidents</h2>
        <p>Many of the scenarios in the PHA, including scenarios that could lead to an anhydrous-ammonia release, were based on known failure mechanisms or previous incidents, at the facility or elsewhere. In cases where a specific previous incident was discussed by the PHA team, this may be summarized in the applicable scenario or elsewhere in this report. Each scenario includes an optional scenario type field, which may be used to identify scenarios that were based on previous incidents, at any time or place, not just at the facility.</p>

                <i>Cause description:</i><br>
                Some examples are below.<br>
* An ammonia-refrigerant suction control valve rapidly opens (or regulates at a lower pressure) at the start of a power outage,<br>
- if the evaporator was defrosting and filled with hot gas and some liquid (that condensed during defrosting) when the power fails,<br>
&gt; the hot gas, possibly mixed with liquid, may cause shocks in the downstream suction piping, including from vapor-propelled liquid slugs.<br>
* An ammonia-refrigerant hot-gas or liquid solenoid valve opens before adequate pump down, either normally, when power is restored after an outage or blip, or when loads are low. In these cases, vapor-propelled liquid slugs or condensation-induced shocks may occur if:<br>
- liquid enters a coil or piping that is mostly filled with hot gas, due to controls shortcoming or human error, such as defrosting before a power outage or blip and the controls immediately start cooling when the power outage or blip ends,<br>
- hot gas enters a coil or piping that is partly filled with liquid, due to controls shortcoming, human error, or low loads.<br>
* See the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) report and safety bulletin on the<br>
- 2010 ammonia leak, at the Millard Refrigerated Services, Theodore, Alabama, for example<br>
- CSB, January 2015, Hydraulic Shock Safety Bulletin, Key Lessons for Preventing Hydraulic Shock in Industrial Refrigeration Systems.<br>
* Low loads may cause liquid in a coil and piping to evaporate slower than expected, so that<br>
- a pre-set pump-down time is not long enough, leading to<br>
&gt; hot gas entering a coil and piping that are partly filled with liquid.<br>
* Low loads may be caused by:<br>
- higher humidity in the cooled room, thicker frost layers on the coil, and so less heat transfer,<br>
- cold air entering the cooled room,<br>

(B.1.1) near welded joints, both the weld metal and the heat-affected zone, or <br>

* Compressors, screw, motor [VERIFY FOR TYPES OF COMPRESSORS AT THE FACILITY]<br>
- gas moved inefficiently from oil separator to piping between suction check valve and compressor,<br>
- if high-current (amp) protection does not shutoff the motor, possible overpressure and leak on suction side, though a suction-check-valve bypass may relieve some of this,<br>
- also possible overheating, similar to compressor starved, so a high-oil temperature sensor may cause the motor to shutoff.<br>
* Compressor, screw, oil pump motor -- oil flow in wrong direction before compressor starts, and the compressor motor won't start due to low oil pressure.<br>
* Compressor, screw, slide valve motor -- slide valve operates in wrong direction. See compressor loads up too quickly consequences.<br>
* Compressors, reciprocating (Vilter or similar), motor -- typically little consequence except increased wear and tear. Oil pump operates with crank shaft turning in either direction.<br>
* Fan motors -- fan blows air inefficiently in the wrong direction.<br>
- Fans for condensers --  inefficient heat transfer, high-condensing temperatures could cause compressors to shutoff due to high-discharge pressure.<br>
- Fans for air-handling units or forced-air evaporators -- inefficient heat transfer and higher air temperatures in cooled spaces.<br>
- Fans for ventilation -- inadequate ventilation,<br>
&gt; if emergency ventilation and ammonia leaked into the ventilated room, could lead to high, possibly flammable, concentrations of ammonia in the room air.<br>
* Pump, centrifugal, motor -- little or no pressure developed at outlet, operational problem only (no ammonia-refrigerant or cooling water flow, depending on the pump, etc.)<br>
* Pump, chemical feed, motor -- no chemical fed, such as for water treatment.<br>
* Pump, gear, motor [DEPENDS ON USE, SUCH AS DESIGN OF TRANSFER SYSTEM, IF PART OF ONE].<br>

                <i>Safeguard description:</i><br>
                At the facility, these controls and safety shutoffs include the following.<br>
* Redundant safeguards, via local controls in the compressor packages, in addition to the central ammonia-refrigeration controls.<br>
* On the vessel [VESSELS] that feeds the all facility ammonia-refrigerant compressors, [__LIST VESSEL(S)__], these include:<br>
- a level probe, which outputs to controls that [OFTEN OPTIONAL]<br>
&gt; signal alarms at an alarm level and then, [OFTEN OPTIONAL]<br>
&gt; on high-level, send shutoff signals to compressor local controls, [OFTEN OPTIONAL]<br>
- a high-high-level float switch that shuts off compressor motors, wired fail safe (no signal or open circuit causes shutoff) and independently from the central ammonia-refrigeration controls.<br>
* In all the ammonia-refrigerant compressor packages, these shutoffs include, at least:<br>
- compressor motor high current (amps) -- also called overload or overcurrent protection,<br>
- compressor motor high temperature (thermal protection),<br>
- high discharge pressure,<br>
- low suction pressure, and<br>
- low oil pressure (the differential pressure that drives lubricating-oil flow, such as shaft-seal-chamber pressure minus suction pressure in Vilter reciprocating compressors).<br>
* In the ammonia-refrigerant screw-compressor packages, these shutoffs also include, at least:<br>
- high discharge temperature, of the ammonia-refrigerant gas,<br>
- high oil-filter differential pressure, <br>
- high oil temperature (after cooling and typically before injection into the screw lubrication system), <br>
- low oil temperature (also prevents the screw compressor from starting until the oil heater has adequately warmed the oil), <br>
- oil-pump motor high current (amps), and<br>
- oil-pump motor high temperature (thermal protection).<br>
* All of the above compressor-safety shutoffs fail safe (no signal or open circuit causes shutoff).<br>
* The screw-compressor slide valves (capacity control and volume ratio) automatically unload when the compressor shuts off or when power is restored after a power outage. The screw compressor local controllers prevent restart until slide valves are unloaded to below 10% of their limits.<br>
* The central ammonia-refrigeration controls automate the loading and unloading of both its reciprocating and screw compressors.<br>
* Inspection, testing, and maintenance (ITM) of the above controls and safeguards are scheduled, described, and documented in<br>
- the facility's maintenance-management system.<br>
*** The following apply to the ammonia-refrigeration system at the facility. ***<br>
* Overheating lowers the viscosity of lubricating oil, which at high enough temperatures causes <br>
- inadequate lubrication. This leads to <br>
- increased wear-and-tear on internal parts, <br>
- often, increased oil leakage from the shaft seal, and<br>
- possibly, ammonia leakage from the shaft seal.<br>
* Additional overheating causes friction that makes the drive shaft harder to turn, increasing the load on the compressor motor, and eventually causing the compressor to seize up (the electric motor cannot turn the shaft).<br>
* In the reciprocating compressors, the crank shaft drives the oil pump, so the low-oil pressure switch should shutoff the compressor motor. If not, high current (amps) protection should shut off the compressor motor,<br>
- except with a belt drive, if a problem (belt breaks, slipping , etc.) causes the motor to run faster than the compressor, the low-oil pressure switch should shutoff the compressor motor. If not, the motor many overheat and, if also not thermally protected, damage insulation, rarely but possibly leading to a small fire that might be the source of a larger fire.<br>
* Overheating, described above, and possibly small ammonia leaks, would be the typical result of gas recirculating from the discharge to suction sides of a reciprocating-compressor crank case because:<br>
- it is running with the discharge valve shut between the compressor and the oil separator (deadheading) and its high discharge-pressure shutoff fails when needed<br>
&gt; causing its internal pressure-relief valve to open, or<br>
- rapid leak by this internal pressure-relief valve.<br>
* The screw compressors are protected from high-oil temperatures by<br>
- high oil temperature shutoffs,<br>
- high discharge temperature shutoffs, <br>
- compressor motor high current (amps) shutoffs (if friction increases due to inadequate lubrication), and <br>
- low oil pressure shutoffs, triggered by the low-oil pressure if the screws seize up because the above shutoffs failed.<br>
* If the following shutoffs are not installed or fail when needed, overheating, described above, and possibly small ammonia leaks, would be the typical result:<br>
- low suction pressure (compressor starved),<br>
- low oil pressure (inadequate oil flow for cooling, lubricating, and seals),<br>
- high oil-filter differential pressure (inadequate oil flow for cooling, lubricating, and seals),<br>
- high oil temperature (or cooling-water low-flow switch, if applicable),<br>
- high discharge temperature,<br>
- compressor motor high current (amps) -- as backup to the above.<br>
*  If the following shutoff is not installed or fails when needed, increased wear and tear would result, if not shut off on low oil pressure,<br>
- low oil temperature.<br>
* Compressor equalizing to suction too quickly, due to <br>
- leak by screw-compressor suction check valve or<br>
- reciprocating-compressor suction stop valve opened too quickly, may<br>
- suck some oil out of the compressor or<br>
- cause pressure in the shaft-seal chamber to be different than in the suction side of the compressor, particularly for reciprocating compressors. This may move the inner shaft seal, causing oil to spray from the shaft-seal chamber onto the compressor internal components, leading to increased wear.<br>
* Compressor loading up too quickly:<br>
- has little effect on reciprocating compressors,<br>
- may lead to wear or internal damage to screw-compressor packages, including their motors,<br>
- if this results in a rapid suction pressure drop, excessive refrigerant boiling in vessels that feed compressors may cause liquid droplets to reach compressors, see the scenario on liquid ammonia sucked into compressors, lots of large droplets or more (slugging).<br>
* Oil pump (for screw compressor) inlet or outlet valve closed when starting or running<br>
- may cause a leak, mostly oil, at the motor-shaft seal, valve-stem seal, or piping joints,<br>
- if an outlet valve, typically the oil-cooler, oil-side, pressure-relief valve would open and relieve the pressure to the compressor oil separator,<br>
- the screw compressor would not start, or would shutoff, on low-oil pressure,<br>
- the oil-pump motor may be shut off by high current (amps) protection.</p><a id="ccsa_safeguard_8"></a><p class="topborder">

- pressure-relief valves on condenser inlet piping, protecting their coils, are typically neither helpful nor required with proper administrative controls, such as only isolating a condenser coil from the rest of the refrigeration system (valving off the condenser) if the isolated coil and piping are promptly vented to atmospheric pressure following a system-opening permit (also called line-breaking permit) or procedure,<br>
- check valves or relief regulators on piping bypassing the main stop valves at condenser-coil outlets are only needed if condenser coils are valved off seasonally, such as in winter, in which case they allow fluids to safely return from a condenser coil to the rest of the refrigeration system, for example, if ammonia refrigerant entered the coil due to leak by an isolating stop valve,<br>
- in the above cases, the high-pressure receiver's overpressure protection also protects the condenser coils.<br>

                <i>Safeguard description:</i><br>
                The facility's ammonia-refrigeration system has the following in place.<br>
* Hot-gas defrost (HGD) piping pitches to<br>
- a liquid drainer,<br>
- high-stage discharge (HSD) piping that evaporates any condensed liquid or carries it to condensers without causing vapor propelled liquid slugs, such as because the continuous gas flow in the HSD piping is much greater than any condensed-liquid flow entering from HGD piping,<br>
- or another safe location.<br>
* Rules of thumb that are followed:<br>
- soft start of hot-gas defrost (soft gas) is needed if the hot-gas solenoid valve is 1.5-inch (nominal size) or larger or if the evaporating temperature is below zero Fahrenheit (0 F),<br>
- suction control valve slow-opening or bleed-by is needed if suction control valves are 2.5-inch (nominal size) or larger or if the evaporator coil is 15 tons refrigeration (TR) or larger, and<br>
- each forced-air evaporator above 1 TR is served by a separate valve group, which includes the liquid, suction, and hot-gas control valves.<br>
* Defrost, hot gas, includes adequately gradual and long delay and/or pump-down times (optionally lengthened by interlocked pressure transducers), both before and after defrost:<br>
- the before-defrost pump-down time is adequate to remove liquid ammonia from the evaporator coil and piping that hot gas will enter, avoiding shocks, such as from:<br>
&gt; vapor-propelled liquid slugs and condensation-induced shock,<br>
- the after-defrost delay and/or pump-down time (also called equalize or bleed time) is adequately gradual and long to avoid excessive shocks in both:<br>
&gt; the suction piping downstream of the suction control valve, when it opens or regulates at a lower pressure, and<br>
&gt; the evaporator coil and piping, when liquid ammonia-refrigerant enters them to restart cooling.<br>
* Metal fatigue due to rapid temperature changes is also reduced by both of the above pump-down times.<br>
* The before-defrost pump-down time is also long enough to remove all liquid ammonia under reasonable worst-case scenarios, based on operating experience or by assuming the evaporator coil may be mostly full of liquid due to a low load, maybe because the coil was heavily frosted up before defrost due to higher than usual humidity in the cooled air.<br>
* There is no incentive to unsafely reduce pump-down times because doing so would not increase production [OR DESCRIBE PASSWORDS OR OTHER CONTROLS THAT PREVENT REDUCING PUMP-DOWN TIMES] and the current timing has worked well since at least [__YEAR__] [OR DESCRIBE TESTING THAT WAS DONE TO VERIFY THE PUMP-DOWN TIMES].<br>
* At the start and end of a power outage or blip, shutoff and restart occur safely regardless of the state an evaporator was in when the power failed, for example:<br>
- if a suction control valve automatically opens (or regulates at a lower pressure) when power fails during defrost,<br>
&gt; excessive shocks won't occur,<br>
&gt; any needed slow-opening or bleed-by function adequately when the power fails,<br>
- for all types of suction control valves, there is adequate<br>
&gt; pump-down to suction pressure after power is restored, before control valves allow either liquid or hot gas into evaporators [NEEDS DEPEND ON IF CONTROLS RETAIN MEMORY OF EVAPORATOR STATE BEFORE POWER OUTAGE],<br>
&gt; freeze on (also called rechill) before fans start, as needed to prevent water droplets from blowing onto people, product, etc.,<br>
&gt; staggering of valve openings, to avoid excessive flows in piping headers or to vessels,<br>

                Taking into account that some ammonia leaks, either inside or outside the refrigerating-machinery room (the room) for the facility's ammonia-refrigeration system, cannot practically be controlled by the room's safety systems and so would require incident-specific evacuation or shelter-in-place -- the room:<br>
* was built per [CODE CITATION, IF ANY],<br>
* is adjacent to [DESCRIBE SURROUNDINGS],<br>
* has some explosion venting provided by ventilation inlets and outlets and by its roof, which are reasonably safely located for this,<br>
* has adequate access and egress, including <br>
- clear heights and aisles between equipment and piping,<br>
- that complies with the applicable building code, if any (otherwise in refrigerating-machinery rooms, without automatic sprinkler systems [unsprinklered], building-code requirements often include a maximum 75-foot "common path of egress travel", which is "that portion of exit access travel distance measured from the most remote point of each room, area or space to that point where the occupants have separate and distinct access to two exits or exit access doorways", so if a unsprinklered refrigerating-machinery room had only one exit or exit access doorway, no part of that room should be further than 75-feet from that doorway, and if such a room had more than one exit or exit access doorway, there should be neither blind aisles nor alcoves more than 75 feet deep without an exit or exit access doorway, see for example International Building Code 2018, Chapter 10, specifically Section 1006), <br>
- no part of the room is further than 150-feet from an exit or exit access doorway, unless permitted by the building code, <br>
- if the room's floor area is greater than 1,000 square feet, it has more than one exit or exit access doorway horizontally separated by more than half of the room's maximum horizontal dimension (one may be accessed by a fixed ladder or alternating-tread device), <br>
- each exit or exit access doorway is equipped with panic hardware and swings open in the direction of egress travel, <br>
- fire rating of doors is <br>
&gt; same as exterior wall, if to outside, or <br>
&gt; 1-hour, if to inside and the room is unsprinklered (IIAR 2-2019, 5.17.8 and 6.10; IIAR 9-2020 7.3.3 and 7.3.9), and <br>
- the room is kept tidy and its floors are not slippery, such as due to oil spills or similar, <br>
* has neither open flames nor surfaces greater than 800 F (427 C) in the room, except: <br>
- fuel-burning appliances that <br>
&gt; are shutoff by a sensor upon detection of ammonia at the concentration that starts the emergency ventilation or <br>
&gt; have a sealed combustion chamber reliably fed by air from outside the room that is reasonably unlikely to contain ammonia during a leak and <br>
- matches and sulfur sticks used to detect leaks if any ongoing oil or ammonia draining or charging has been stopped once the leak started (IIAR 9-2020 7.3.5), <br>
* has access to safety showers and eye/face washes, built and maintained following ANSI/ISEA Z358.1, including <br>
- one inside the room, <br>
- one outside the room and a maximum 10-second travel time (typically 55 feet) from its door, and <br>
- additional as needed for a maximum 10-second travel time (typically 55 feet), without doors or other obstructions in the travel path, from all walking-working surfaces in the room to the safety shower and eye/face wash (IIAR 9-2020 7.3.7), <br>
* has floor drains or equivalent as needed to keep the floor reasonably free of water, with engineered or administrative means for handling oil or other liquid spills (IIAR 9-2020 7.3.8),<br>
* has at least one tamper-resistant, off-only, ammonia-refrigeration emergency-stop switch/button (E-stop), located near the room and where reasonably likely to remain safe and accessible during ammonia releases, and which shuts off the electrical-power supply to <br>
- all ammonia-refrigeration system <br>
&gt; compressors, <br>
&gt; pumps, and<br>
&gt; normally-closed control valves that are not part of an emergency-control system, such as solenoid valves for liquid and hot-gas supply, and<br>
- all other electrically powered equipment in the refrigerating-machinery room that could serve as an ignition source, such as water and chemical feed pumps, but<br>
- it doesn't shut off safety systems, such as ammonia-in-air sensors and alarms, emergency lighting, and emergency ventilation, which are built to have a low likelihood of creating an ignition source, <br>
[VERIFY ABOVE AND DETAIL ANY E-STOP BUTTONS FOR ONLY PORTIONS OF THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM.]<br>
* has ammonia sensor(s) in the room, <br>
- sampling where ammonia concentrations could likely be highest (so not near fresh-air inlets), <br>
- in enough locations, considering the size of the room, <br>
- accessible for inspection, testing, and maintenance (ITM), <br>
- connected to detectors and alarm systems adequate to, at or below the following parts per million by volume, ammonia concentrations in air (ppm) <br>
no ppm signal, such as due to a malfunction or a power loss on the dedicated-branch electrical circuit for these systems -- notify Owner/Operator representatives qualified to muster assistance in emergencies and likely to be reachable on holidays and off hours (so alarms in an always-attended location or the alarm system can call out to multiple people's phones or a reliable answering service with a call list), <br>
25 ppm -- activate audible (15 decibels above average-ambient and 5 decibels above expected maximum-ambient sound pressure) and visible alarms in the room and outside its doors (automatic reset allowed once concentration falls below 25 ppm), <br>
50 ppm (preferably 25 ppm) -- notify Owner/Operator representatives, similarly to "no ppm signal" above, <br>
1000 ppm (preferably no higher than 150 ppm, which is half the immediately dangerous to life or health, IDLH, concentration) -- activate the room's emergency ventilation (manual reset required), and <br>
40,000 ppm (preferably no higher than 15,000 ppm, which is approximately one tenth, 10%, of the lower flammability limit, LFL, of ammonia in dry air, but mixtures of ammonia gas and lubricating-oil mists are more flammable than ammonia alone) -- trigger the same response as the above-described E-stop (manual reset required) (IIAR 2-2019 6.13 and IIAR 9-2020 7.3.12),<br>
* is well sealed, so that <br>
- the fire ratings of its envelop (walls, floors, ceilings, and so forth) are maintained, <br>
- air could not flow between the room and other interior spaces, including around or inside things that penetrate its envelop, such as piping, conduits, or ducts, and access panels for ducts were gasketed and tight fitting (IIAR 9-2020 7.3.2.1, 7.3.2.5, and 7.3.6.2),<br>
* has adequate signs outside its entrances and for its safety systems,<br>
* has adequately safe storage of flammable and combustible materials, if any, such as<br>
- all of these are stored in approved fire-rated storage containers (IIAR 9-2020 7.3.4), <br>
- their quantities are kept to the minimum needed for operations and maintenance, and <br>
- their quantities and proximity are equal to or less that what was assumed in design scenarios for all pressure-relief systems in the room or nearby, <br>
* has emergency, occupant/normal, and temperature-control ventilation <br>
- with air intakes located where reasonably likely to supply clean outdoor air,<br>
- with adequate exhaust and makeup air flows,<br>
- that sweep the room adequately and without excessive short-circuiting,<br>
- that don't serve other rooms,<br>
* has emergency-ventilation inlets built to avoid failing shut, such as louvers or dampers that open or unlatch on power loss,<br>
* has any backup power and also restart after power outages built to avoid creating ignition sources in flammable atmospheres, such as ammonia sensors that turn on emergency ventilation if needed before any equipment that could create a ignition source receives backup or restored electrical power,<br>
* has exhaust fans that all have:<br>
- non-sparking blades, preferably Air Movement and Control Association (ACMA) Standard 99, type A or B (Spark A or B) spark-resistant construction, and <br>
- totally-enclosed motors, unless the motor is very unlikely to get exposed to a flammable atmosphere while energized, for example outdoors and not in the exhaust-air stream or that shuts/stays off when the emergency-ventilation starts,<br>
* has an emergency-ventilation outlet(s) that discharges<br>
- upward [OPTION: ADD DETAILS, PER APPLICABLE CODE, SUCH AS 2,500 FEET PER MINUTE PER IIAR 2-2010 TO 2019], above the roof of the refrigerating-machinery room,<br>
- adequately far from air intakes, doors, ladders, property boundaries, walkways, windows that are sometimes open, and work areas,<br>
- where it is reasonably unlikely to contaminate breathing air, in excess of 150 ppm, 220 ppm, or another reasonable target -- considering any nearby higher roofs and air recirculation (swirling and eddies) on the downwind side of the building with the ventilation outlet -- in<br>
&gt; areas where people are routinely present or<br>
&gt; exit routes from normally occupied spaces, <br>
150 ppm is the 1-hour exposure 2016 ERPG-2 (American Industrial Hygiene Association, Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2) -- the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all people could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair a persons ability to take protective action.<br>
220 ppm is both the 10 and 30-minute exposure 2017 AEGL-2 (Acute Exposure Guideline Levels, published by the U.S. EPA) -- the concentration above which it is predicted that the general population, including susceptible individuals, could experience irreversible or other serious, long-lasting adverse health effects or an impaired ability to escape.<br>
* has an electrical-power supply for emergency ventilation, safety alarms, and emergency lighting that is not shutoff by any emergency-stop switch/button, ammonia sensors, and similar,  <br>
* has alarms on loss of power or known failure of ventilation systems that notify Owner/Operator representatives qualified to muster assistance in emergencies and likely to be reachable on holidays and off hours (so alarms in an always-attended location or the alarm system can call out to multiple people's phones or a reliable answering service with a call list), (IIAR 9-2020 7.3.13.2)<br>
* has temperature control via thermostat [OR DESCRIBE OTHER ADEQUATE CONTROL],<br>
* has emergency-ventilation control via manual on/auto switch and ammonia sensors,<br>
* has an emergency-ventilation turn-on set point of 150 ppm or lower, so the concentration in the discharged air would, at least initially, typically be below the 300 ppm IDLH concentration.<br>
* If work needs to be done near where exposure to ammonia in emergency or normal ventilation discharges could occur, appropriate precautions are taken.<br>

                The Owner/Operator has implemented policies, notifications, and training as needed at the facility for the following.<br>
* Ammonia-refrigeration system.<br>
- All facility employees and contractors are notified or trained that only authorized personnel can touch the ammonia-refrigeration system, including:<br>
&gt; controls,<br>
&gt; valves, or<br>
&gt; work of any kind.<br>
- If opening the ammonia-refrigeration system to the atmosphere, these authorized personnel get and follow:<br>
&gt; applicable lockout-tagout policies and/or procedures and<br>
&gt; a system-opening permit (also called line-breaking permit) and/or<br>
&gt; a procedure for the activity that is described in writing and approved by the facility's qualified ammonia-refrigeration system contractor or the responsible individual(s), per the Owner/Operator management system, such as for routine oil draining or for tie-in of new equipment;<br>
- the above address and, as needed, have warnings about:<br>
&gt; verifying no leak-by (backflow across) check valves when compressors or pumps are shutoff,<br>
&gt; ammonia buildup under rarely opened seal caps, covering valve stems without hand wheels,<br>
&gt; packing leaks, especially when valves are moved off their fully back-seated position,<br>
&gt; loosening threaded bonnets when turning the stems of control or stop valves, if applicable,<br>
&gt; properly lubricating valve stems (but not with copper-containing anti-seize),<br>
&gt; not using too much force when turning valve stems or seal caps,<br>
&gt; trapping liquid ammonia when shutting valves,<br>
&gt; leaks when equipment or piping is opened to the atmosphere, such as from leak by the seat of an isolating valve, which may be addressed by monitoring pressure after isolating but before opening part of the ammonia-refrigeration system,<br>
&gt; shock cooling, including by venting equipment or piping that still contains liquid ammonia to the atmosphere,<br>
&gt; draining oil from a compressor without shutting off and locking out its oil heater,<br>
&gt; accidental return of hazardous energy to opened equipment or piping,<br>
&gt; leaks or shocks when valves are opened to put equipment back in service.<br>
- If connecting joints (bolted, threaded, welded...) or support fasteners, these authorized personnel:<br>
&gt; follow applicable good practices, procedures, and manufacturer instructions, such as<br>
&gt; for threaded joints, clean threads and apply pipe-thread compound or equivalent, compatible with the ammonia-refrigeration system, before properly tightening.<br>
- If disabling safety systems for maintenance, such as emergency ventilation, these authorized personnel:<br>
&gt; follow a procedure for the activity that is described in writing and approved by the facility's qualified ammonia-refrigeration system contractor or the responsible individual(s), per the Owner/Operator management system,<br>
- If replacing pressure-relief valves, these authorized personnel:<br>
&gt; get and follow a system-opening permit (also called line-breaking permit),<br>
&gt; when practical, pump down to suction pressure and safely isolate equipment and piping before replacing the pressure-relief valve(s) serving that equipment and piping (except for large vessels, like the receiver and recirculator vessels, this is often practical and safe), and <br>
&gt; otherwise (if not practical to isolate before replacement) they (A) check that the ammonia-refrigeration system is operating properly before starting pressure-relief valve replacement, (B) have a watcher who can initiate emergency plans, including any needed and safe leak mitigation, and (C) wear appropriate personal protective equipment, considering the possibility that another pressure-relief valve opens on a shared inlet valve or shared outlet relief-vent piping or that they accidentally remove an in-service pressure-relief valve,<br>
- After a  power failure, leak, or emergency shutdown, these authorized personnel follow (or develop for Owner/Operator approval prior to restart) procedures for these that cover:<br>
&gt; how the ammonia-refrigeration system, including its controls, responds to power blips, outages, and power restoration (including interrupted defrosting, if applicable),<br>
&gt; any needed human actions during outages or upon power restoration,<br>
&gt; restart after shutdowns due to a high level in a vessel that feeds compressors, and<br>
&gt; restart after ammonia leaks or emergency shutdowns.<br>
